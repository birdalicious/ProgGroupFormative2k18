Interest of Content
===================
Excellent
---------
The site covers a range of topics, all of which have connections to computer science but also explore other fields (such as physics and biology). Although all pages are detailed, some have more factual content than others. Perhaps some links to external sources would be a good future addition to the site.

Consistency & Quality of Visual Presentation
============================================
Outstanding
-----------
A high-quality theme has been used throughout, demonstrating good knowledge of CSS and JS. Animations have been used to make the site more user-friendly. The theme is consistent across the site. Some images accompanying the content would be appreciated.

Quality of Written Presentation
===============================
Very Good
---------
On the whole, the quality of written communication is very good. There are a few spelling and grammatical inaccuracies, and also some instances where better use of punctuation would make the content slightly more readable. Abbreviations should perhaps be explained.

Validity of HTML
================
Excellent
---------
The HTML is well written and produces a site with no obvious formatting errors. All conventions are correctly followed. Only one typing error was found, but this does not seem to affect the site itself.

Evidence of Collaboration
=========================
Very Good
---------
There is evidence that the author pages were written by someone other than the author. However, the authors edited their own images. Contribution was from both members of the group. It is clear that work was not completed at the last minute.
